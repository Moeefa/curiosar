		"description": "Annual Analysis – Poconé/MT (2019)\n\nIn 2019, Poconé/MT experienced a significant increase in fire activity, with 499 hotspots detected. The total FRP reached 27,567, and the average FRP was 55.25, reflecting moderate fire intensity throughout the year.\n\nFires were more evenly distributed across seasons compared to previous years, with the dry season accounting for 42.1% of occurrences and the rainy season contributing 57.9%, indicating that fire activity extended beyond the traditional dry months. The peak month was November, with 141 hotspots, marking a slightly delayed peak relative to earlier years.\n\nClimatic correlations revealed that temperature had a positive and statistically significant effect on fire occurrences (r = +0.240; p < 0.05), suggesting that warmer conditions favored fire activity. Other variables, including humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and dew point, showed weak or non-significant correlations, indicating limited influence of short-term meteorological changes.\n\nOverall, 2019 was marked by a high number of fires spread across both dry and rainy seasons, highlighting the combined role of climatic conditions and other factors such as human activity in driving fire dynamics in the Pantanal. The year underscores the need for year-round monitoring and fire management strategies.",

		"description": "Annual Analysis – Poconé/MT (2022)\n\nIn 2022, Poconé/MT experienced a low fire season, with 227 hotspots detected. The total FRP reached 10,887, and the average FRP was 47.96, showing a marked reduction in fire intensity and frequency compared to previous years.\n\nInterestingly, the rainy season dominated fire occurrences, accounting for 93.4% of hotspots, while the dry season contributed only 6.6%. The peak month was December, with 125 fires, which is later than the typical peak in the dry season, reflecting the strong influence of an unusually wet year.\n\nClimatic correlations in 2022 were not statistically significant, indicating that fires were less influenced by temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, or dew point, likely due to the prevailing wet conditions that suppressed fire activity.\n\nOverall, 2022 highlights the impact of rainfall and wet conditions on fire suppression, demonstrating that even regions usually prone to fires like Poconé can experience significant variability in fire activity depending on climate patterns.",

		"description": "Annual Analysis – Poconé/MT (2023)\n\nIn 2023, Poconé/MT experienced a significant fire season, with 2,372 hotspots detected. The total FRP reached 326,760, and the average FRP was 137.76, indicating a high intensity of fires, particularly compared to previous years.\n\nDespite the dry season being relatively small (16.6% of hotspots), the rainy season accounted for 83.4% of fire detections, showing that fires occurred even under wet conditions, likely due to accumulated dry fuel and human activity. The peak month was November, with 1,900 hotspots, reflecting a late-season fire surge.\n\nSignificant climatic correlations were observed:\n\nTemperature positively correlated with fire occurrence (r = +0.361, p<0.01).\n\nHumidity negatively correlated (r = -0.341, p<0.01).\n\nWind speed showed a weak positive correlation (r = +0.241, p<0.05).\n\nPrecipitation and dew point had no significant effect on fire activity, suggesting that other factors beyond immediate rainfall influenced the large number of fires.\n\nOverall, 2023 highlights that fire activity in Poconé can intensify even during the rainy season, underscoring the complex interplay of climate, fuel accumulation, and anthropogenic influence in fire dynamics.",

The maximum FRP reached 3,001, highlighting occasional extreme fire events.\n\nThe dry season dominated, accounting for 87.5% of all fires, while the rainy season contributed only 12.5%. October was the critical month, with 678 hotspots, showing a strong concentration of fire activity during the late dry season.\n\nClimatic correlations showed:\n\nTemperature positively correlated with fire occurrence (r = +0.287, p<0.01), suggesting higher temperatures contributed to fire activity.\n\nHumidity, precipitation, wind, and dew point showed no significant correlations, indicating that other factors, such as accumulated dry biomass and human activity, likely drove fire occurrences in 2024.\n\nOverall, 2024 exhibited intense dry-season fires, emphasizing the vulnerability of the Pantanal region to fire even under moderate climatic variability.",
